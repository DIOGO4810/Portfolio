            Hello, my name is DiogoðŸ‘‹
            <br /> <br />
            I am a Computer Engineering student at the University of Minho, and
            programming has sparked my curiosity since the 9th grade. I live in
            Braga, in the parish of Palmeira, and I like to divide my time
            between studying and other activities that motivate me. Besides
            programming, running is one of my greatest passions, helping me
            maintain a balance between focus and well-being.
            <br />

            <p className="text">
              Programming has always fascinated me, especially when it involves
              understanding how things work behind the scenes. I have a great
              interest in low-level programming because I enjoy the idea of
              optimizing code and working close to hardware architecture,
              exploring languages like C and Assembly.

            <p className="text">
              Nowadays, I want to learn more about CUDA because I find it
              interesting how GPUs can be used to accelerate parallel
              computations. Although I haven't started studying it in depth yet,
              it is an area that sparks my curiosity and one that I intend to
              explore in the future.

              Interests in learning more about infrastructure
            </h2>
            <p className="text">
              I also have an interest in infrastructure, from configuring and
              managing servers to system scalability. Understanding how
              large-scale applications are implemented and maintained is
              something I haven't had the chance to explore as much as I would
              like.

            <p className="text">
              And of course, like many programmers, I am also curious about
              developing applications and websites, exploring different
              technologies and frameworks to create functional and intuitive
              interfaces. Whether in web or mobile development, I like the idea
              of building something from scratch and seeing the final result
              working.
